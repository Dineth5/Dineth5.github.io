Hi, my name is Dineth! I am currently pursuing my MSc in Computational Biomedical Engineering at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). Before that, I graduated from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk) with a degree in Mechanical Engineering under the mentorship of my supervisor [Dr. Amir Keshmiri](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/a.keshmiri).

My academic interests lie at the intersection of engineering and medicine â€” in particular, using simulation and numerical modelling to address challenges in healthcare. I am currently working on publishing my undergraduate dissertation in Scientific Reports, where I quantitatively evaluated the likelihood of aneurysm rupture.

In the summer of 2024, I interned as a Research and Design Engineer at both [NAFFCO](https://www.naffco.com) and [DANWAY](https://danwaygroup.com)
