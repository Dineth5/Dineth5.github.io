## Overview

The project focused on creating a device to help firefighters advance hoses during high-pressure operations while preventing kinks that restrict water flow. The design prioritized robustness, ease of use, and low-cost manufacturability, making it suitable for deployment in rural and underprivileged areas where resources are limited.

### How the Design Works

The system consists of two complementary modules — the Gripping Rover for hose advancement and the Unkinking Shuttle for kink removal. Together, they allow firefighters to advance hoses continuously, even in the presence of kinks.

**Gripping Rover**

- Two-module chassis with a central pivot for unpowered steering, keeping the device aligned without electronics.
- Six all-terrain wheels, with the front pair powered independently for traction.
- Water-resistant, heat-shielded battery housing with quick-release access.

**Unkinking Shuttle**

- Three modules: a powered central roller unit and two unpowered alignment modules.
- Hinged connectors allow the shuttle to snake along bends until it reaches a kink.
- Magnetic docking system for secure storage and easy deployment.

**Triangular Wheels**

- Each assembly uses three rotating sub-wheels.
- Provides “stepping” motion to climb over rough terrain or obstacles.

**Hose Grip**

- Concave arms shaped for 45 mm and 64 mm hoses.
- Rubber lining for high friction and slip prevention.
- Open-top actuator design for quick mounting and release.

## Sustainability Considerations

The Fire Hose Advancer supports three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

- **SDG 2: Zero Hunger** – In rural and under-resourced areas, firefighting relies on self-organised efforts. The device simplifies hose advancement for minimally trained individuals and resolves kinks automatically, allowing communities to better protect crops and reduce famine risks caused by wildfires.

- **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** – Modular design and standardised off-the-shelf components reduce energy demands during manufacturing and simplify repairs. The chassis uses recycled aluminium, which is lightweight, durable, and infinitely recyclable, extending the device’s lifespan and supporting a circular economy.

- **SDG 15: Life on Land** – Wildfires destroy forests, wildlife habitats, and agricultural land globally. This device allows a single firefighter to advance hoses efficiently, while the automatic unkinking system reduces downtime, improving wildfire response and protecting ecosystems.
