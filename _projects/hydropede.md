#### Overview

Hydro-pede was the initial concept design in the development of the [Fire Hose Crawler](https://dineth5.github.io/projects/firehose/).  
The design took inspiration from biomimetics, specifically the segmented locomotion of centipedes and millipedes, to create a modular crawler capable of traversing alongside and supporting a pressurised fire hose.

#### Concept Design Requirements

- Developing the chosen concept into an embodiment design compliant with engineering principles and design codes.
- Identifying links to sustainable development goals (SDGs) and considering Equality, Diversity, Inclusion and Access (EDIA) aspects.
- Producing clear, well-presented concept sketches with annotations only.

#### Results

- Grade: 95%
- **Feedback highlights:**
  - Excellent concept presentation through sketches and clear mechanisms.
  - Areas for improvement:
    - Power cable management (exposed cable may deform or cause safety issues).
    - Hose threading mechanism could be automated for efficiency.
    - Larger wheels recommended to improve terrain handling.
  - The modular body design and integrated battery pack enhanced adaptability and ensured mobility in remote areas, reinforcing the practicality of the Hydro-pede concept.
