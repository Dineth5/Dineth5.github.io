**Overview**

VIMA is a detachable handle designed to assist visually impaired users by detecting obstacles and providing real-time haptic feedback. It replicates the sensation of a traditional white cane while detecting both ground-level and overhanging obstacles.

**Development**

- Designed 3D CAD models and detailed 2D engineering drawings for the enclosure using SolidWorks.
- Implemented electrical infrastructure with Arduino and multiple sensors.
- Fabricated prototypes using rapid prototyping techniques, including 3D printing.

**Results**

- Achieved 95% similarity in obstacle detection and haptic feedback compared to traditional white canes.
- Enabled visually impaired users to navigate urban environments more accurately and safely.
- Received over Â£5,000 in funding from [Sister](https://sistermanchester.com) and [Masood Entrepreneurship Center](https://www.entrepreneurship.manchester.ac.uk).
