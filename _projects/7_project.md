#### Overview

**Hydropede** was the initial concept design that inspired the development of the [Fire Hose Crawler](https://dineth5.github.io/projects/fire_hose/).  
The design took inspiration from **biomimetics**, specifically the segmented locomotion of centipedes and millipedes, to create a modular crawler capable of traversing alongside and supporting a pressurised fire hose.

#### Concept Design Requirements

The project was part of **Design 3 (MECH31041)**, with objectives including:

- Generating and evaluating conceptual design ideas using a formalised method.
- Developing the chosen concept into an embodiment design compliant with engineering principles and design codes.
- Identifying links to **sustainable development goals (SDGs)** and considering **Equality, Diversity, Inclusion and Access (EDIA)** aspects.
- Producing clear, well-presented concept sketches with annotations only.

#### Outcome

- **Grade:** 95%
- **Feedback highlights:**
  - Excellent concept presentation through sketches and clear mechanisms.
  - Areas for improvement:
    - Power cable management (exposed cable may deform or cause safety issues).
    - Hose threading mechanism could be automated for efficiency.
    - Larger wheels recommended to improve terrain handling.
  - Formatting refinements suggested (page numbers, figure label alignment).

The Hydropede served as a foundation for the refined fire hose crawler, bridging the gap between biomimetic inspiration and practical engineering embodiment.
