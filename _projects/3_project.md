## Overview

The project focused on creating a device to help firefighters advance hoses during high-pressure operations while preventing kinks that restrict water flow. The design prioritized robustness, ease of use, and low-cost manufacturability, making it suitable for deployment in rural and underprivileged areas where resources are limited.

### How the Design Works

The system was developed in two complementary design directions:

- **Rover Design** – A two-module chassis with a central pivot for unpowered automatic steering. The battery housing was made water-resistant and heat-protected to withstand wildfire conditions.
- **Shuttle Design** – A three-module system with two unpowered units featuring concave rollers for hose alignment, and one powered unit providing propulsion. An adjustable roller gap allowed for quick hose mounting and removal.

## Sustainability Considerations

The design with three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

- **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being** – by improving safety for firefighters.
- **SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure** – through engineering innovation and manufacturability.
- **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** – by selecting durable and recyclable materials.

These considerations ensured that the project addressed not only technical performance but also global sustainability challenges.

## Results

The project achieved a grade of **82%**. Key feedback highlighted:

- A **clear and systematic evaluation** process (Selection Matrix).
- A **comprehensive design overview** with detailed CAD models.
- **Strong operational clarity**, showing exactly how the device functions.
- **Well-integrated sustainability considerations** linked to SDGs.
