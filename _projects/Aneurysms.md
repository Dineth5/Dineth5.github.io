### Overview

My undergraduate dissertation, _Computational Fluid Dynamics for Intracranial Aneurysms in Clinical Settings_, was conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Amir Keshmiri](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/a.keshmiri) and is currently pending publication in Scientific Reports.

### Results

- Achieved a final grade of 91% for the dissertation.
- Awarded a grade of 100% for the accompanying poster.
- Successfully segmented patient-specific intracranial aneurysm geometries from medical imaging data.
- Developed and validated high-fidelity CFD meshes to capture aneurysmal blood flow.
- Simulations in STAR-CCM+ demonstrated distinct haemodynamic responses under different treatment strategies:
  - Endovascular coiling reduced flow velocity but in some cases left regions of residual circulation.
  - Flow-diverting stents provided greater reduction in inflow jet momentum, lowering wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index across the aneurysm dome.
- Quantitative haemodynamic analysis showed that elevated OSI and WSS gradients correlated strongly with rupture-prone regions, in line with published clinical literature.
- The study presented a proof-of-concept for employing patient-specific CFD as a clinical decision-support tool in endovascular treatment planning.
